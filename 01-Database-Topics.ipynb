A database with a single table may not feel or function much differently from a spreadsheet. Much of the benefit of using databases results from designing them as models of complex systems in ways that spreadsheets just can't do:\n",

    "# The Entity Relationship Data Model\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The entity relationship (ER) model is commonly used to define and develop databases. In the simplest terms, the model defines the things (entities) that are important or interesting within a system or process and the relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For demonstration purposes, we will construct an ER model of data recorded in the _ATF observation check-lists October - December 1964 (ATF 6)_, published online by the [Biodiversity Heritage Library](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "> National Museum of Natural History (U.S.) Pacific Ocean Biological Survey Program (1964). ATF observation check-lists October - December 1964 (ATF 6). https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/246338. DOI: 10.5962/bhl.title.146255 \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the lists at [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/246338#page/1/mode/1up](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/246338#page/1/mode/1up), what are some of the challenges related to transferring these data to a flat spreadsheet?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Entities\n",
    "\n",
    "Entities are _nouns_, and can be physical or logical:\n",
    "\n",
    "* People - teachers, students, courses\n",
    "* Places - stores, websites, states\n",
    "* Things - donuts, grades, purchases\n",
    "\n",
    "Entities are represented as tables within a database. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Entities have properties or attributes which describe them. For each attribute there is domain, or a range of legal values. Domains can be limited by data type - integer, string, etc. - and may be further limited by allowable values. For example, the domain of month names is limited to January, February, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Simple attributes__ are atomic values which cannot be decomposed or divided. Examples include _age_, _last name_, _glaze_, etc.\n",
    "* __Composite attributes__ consist of multiple simple attributes, such as _address_, _full name_, etc.\n",
    "* __Multivalued attributes__ can include a set of more than one value. _Phone numbers_, _certifications_, etc. are examples of multivalued attributes.\n",
    "* __Derived attributes__ can be calculated using other attributes. A common example is _age_, which can be calculated from a date of birth.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "A key is an attribute or combination of attributes which can be used to uniquely identify individual entities within the entity set. That is, keys enforce a uniqueness constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple types of keys. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A __candidate key__ is a simple or composite key that is both unique and minimal. _Minimal_ here means that every included attribute is needed to establish uniqueness. A table or entity set may have more than one candidate keys.\n",
    "* A __composite key__ is a key composed of two or more attributes. Composite keys are also minimal.\n",
    "* A __primary key__ is the candidate key which is selected to uniquely identify entities in the entity set.\n",
    "* A __foreign key__ is an attribute the references the primary key of another table or entity set in the database.\n",
